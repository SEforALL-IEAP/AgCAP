## Discription of the code
This code:
- takes as input the enhanced settlement layer with all the relevant data extracted into it
- performs the required transformations
- calculates the main composite indices required for the analysis
- visualizes the results
- allows to perform a multi-criteria analysis for customized site selection and ranking processes

Note1 : This version takes enhanced Mozambique settlement layer with extracted attributes prepared manually in QGIS. A future verison will take the output of the main AgCAP code developed by Alexandros Korkovelos, which is meant to replace the manual QGIS data manipulation and extraction.

Note 2: The input file for the code, containing the manually processed setlements for Mozambique, can be found here: https://seforallorg.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/Middle-Earth/En3hRn9tReVKiissOEETOR0BYh0AT6vJKxR3q04A37eLIA?e=lesc1z
