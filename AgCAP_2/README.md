## Discription of the code
This code:
- takes as input the enhanced settlement layer with all the relevant data extracted into it
- performs the required transformations
- calculates the main composite indices required for the analysis
- visualizes the results
- allows to perform a multi-criteria analysis for customized site selection and ranking processes

Note: This version takes enhanced Mozambique settlement layer with extracted attributes prepared manually in QGIS. A future verison will take the output of the main AgCAP code developed by Alexandros Korkovelos, which is meant to replace the manual QGIS data manipulation and extraction.
